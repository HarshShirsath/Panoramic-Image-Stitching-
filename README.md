# Panoramic Image Stitching
#### Instructions:
1. **Run the panorama.py script.**
2. Extract features from each frame using any feature extractor.
3. Match features between each consecutive image and visualize them.
4. Compute homographies between pairs of images.
5. Combine these frames using the computed homographies to create a panoramic image.
